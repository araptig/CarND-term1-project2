## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks techniques are used to classify traffic signs. Such networks will be trained and validated to classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, the model will be tested on images of German traffic signs found on the web.


The project contains two key files: 
* the Ipython notebook [P2.ipynb](https://github.com/araptig/CarND-term1-project2-Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/P2.ipynb)
* a writeup report [P2.pdf](https://github.com/araptig/CarND-term1-project2-Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/P2.pdf)

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
